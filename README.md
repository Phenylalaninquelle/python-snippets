# python-snippets
Small snippets of python code from past projects that could be useful in the future. 

Functionalities with high potential for reusability are collected in a package called `pysnips`. Install it locally with `pip install .` in your favourite virtual env. Code that is less suited for packaging or just too hackish (or not yet sorted) resides in `scripts`. 

Example usage of the package functions can be found in `examples`.

Contents of `pysnips` for now include:

- `pysnips.plotting`
	- **[radar charts](examples/radar_chart_example.py)** (aka spider plots)
	- **[semantic differential](examples/sem_diff_example.py)** (aka profile plots)
